# Create your own input dataset
I built a two-container environment with Docker Compose: one to host
PostgreSQL with seeded data and the other for a Python app that queries and
aggregates it. I was taught how to use Compose for service orchestration and
health checking, as well as forwarding environment variables between containers.
I also got some experience in debugging build contexts and verifying outputs with
mounted volumes. This taught me how containerization makes projects portable
and reproducible.
